# Environmental Signals

R scripts for assessing whether different environmental "signals" show predictable patterns.

The idea behind this is that one model of the effects of early-life adversity, the external PAR model, suggests that early-life environments provide a cue for predicting adult environments, leading to the development of phenotypes that are optimized for those predicted future environments. This idea has received little support in baboons or other long-lived natural animal populations.

It may be useful, as a starting point, to examine those potential cues to see if there's any reliable basis for predicting future states from past states. One way to do this is by quantifying autocorrelation in each "signal" for different time lags.
